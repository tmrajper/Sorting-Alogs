# Sorting-Alogs
Merge, Quick, Exchange Sort

There are two separate folders of code, one for the sorting algorithms, and one for the matrix multiplication.

For the sorting algorithms, run the code and you will be prompted to enter an integer for the size of the array

The program then sorts three different arrays, to avoid sorting already sorted arrays, and then outputs the running 
time of each sorting algorithm in milliseconds, along with the sorted arrays.
